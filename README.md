This is Yukun's script to book badminton automatically in https://buchung.hsz.rwth-aachen.de/angebote/aktueller_zeitraum/_Badmintoncourt_Einzelterminbuchung.html
NOTE: ONLY USE IT IN CASE YOU CAN MANUALLY GET A PLACE LIKE ME!!! :(

You need to preinstall python and selenium package before using the script
* To install python on windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* To install selenium: run 'pip install selenium'

NOTE: as I commented, you need to download the chromedriver.exe that MATCHES your chrome version on windows
from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
and put the file path here. DO NOT USE your local chrome.exe PATH !!!
